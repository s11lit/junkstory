As I said in the magazine interview, I formed another new band based in LA.

I'll also release the band's album and perform live concerts.

18

And after the third solo album with this song "Rocket Dive" comes out next spring, it will be early summer.

There was a place called Dobuita Street where many US soldiers came.

I went there almost everyday.

73

He is currently the representative of "Headwax Organization", which is founded by Hide.

He painted his own plastic models beautifully.

87

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,700

92

One day, he did my homework instead.

93
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,000
And I was called to the teacher and asked, "Matsumoto, what books are you currently reading?"

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In my childhood before I aimed for rock music, I was a fat boy.

I don't remember what my fat percentage was.

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,000
It was when I was in elementary school.

I came back from lunch and they let me run because I was fat.

98
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,300
Hide said, "When I was called to the playground, there were only fat students there".

99
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
"They let us run".

100

He kept telling me that he felt very humiliated at that time.

101
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,000
The boy, Hide, became interested in guitars.

102
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,000
My brother played the folk guitar at that time.

We started like that.

107
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I started dreaming of playing the guitar, recklessly.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He pretended to play the guitar holding a tennis racket.

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,000
Back then, I belonged to the tennis club even though I was fat.

110

Then suddenly my mother came into my room and I was embarrassed.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,500
As far as I can remember, Hide said that his grandmother bought him a guitar.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When I was in 9th grade, I asked my grandmother crying.

114
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
"Grandma, I want to have Gibson Les Paul".

115
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Thus, when I was in junior high school, I sang hit songs medley holding an electric guitar.

116
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
He used to sing anime theme songs.

117
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,000
Hide's favorites were "Mazinger Z", "Devilman", and rock version of "Sazae-san".

118
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,800
When the song to perform was decided, he laughed and played.

119
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,000
He found that his guitar sound was different from the sound coming from TV.

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Then he asked, "Why is this different?"

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't have an effector, so there was no change in the sound.

122
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,000
But I believed that the sound would be different if my guitar skills improved.

123
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I opened the door of his room and saw what he was doing.

124
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hide ripped the back of the guitar off and was applying glue on it.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I asked him if the guitar was broken.

126
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,000
He replied that the sound didn't change.

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,500
I said "It looks to be broken. Is it Okay?",
then he said "Get out of here".

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,700
One day, it was noisy so I was wearing headphones.

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I threw the headphones out and left the room, then, I heard some noise from my room.

130
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,000
I went back to my room to see if I turned off the recorder, and I found it sounded from the headphones.

131
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,000
At that moment, I thought "This is it!"

132
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:30,500
"Everyone is doing this way, even Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Ace Frehley are doing it this way!"

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
After that, I played the guitar by raising the volume wearing headphones.

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,000
From then on, I didn't even touch the amplifier, and just broke six or more headphones.

135
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Learning guitar became an opportunity to meet rock music.

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
One day in junior high school, my friend let me listen to KISS's music in his house.

137
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
But I didn't like KISS's makeup.

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thus, I borrowed the tape, but I just put it away.

139
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,000
One day, I had nothing to do, so I listened to that tape.

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,800
After listening to it, I was shocked, "What's this?"

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It was the first time I was hit by a thunderstorm of music.

142
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,000
I started thinking that I was born for rock.

143
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,000
From then on, my Rock'n'Roll life started.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Later, Hide left these words.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
“If you do not get away from you of those time, you will not find the answer”

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You can't find the answer unless you stay away from yourself in the past.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It took quite a long time for the idea to change.

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,500
Time to reach an unimaginable future for an ordinary boy.

149
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He stared at an audience who didn't focus on the concert.

150
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Then he suddenly jumped into the audience and beat him with a guitar.

151
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I was shocked to see it.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He kept replacing members to raise the band's level.

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,500
Conflict and anguish arose because of the members to be removed.

154
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,000
I heard he was suffering from members problem.

155
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,000
While strictly managing the members to be professional,

156
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
he seemed to be sad every time he changed members.

157
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sometimes he sobbed in the room.

158
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then the moment the best members come together came.

159
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They were vocalist "Kyo" and drummer "Tetsu".

That's true.

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He came with raw ideas and completed them with the people in the studio.

165
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,500
He was improvised.

166
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He didn't like the typical things.

167

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He was a follower of intuition.

170
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,000
The three major garbage bands in Kanto region that influenced Indies scene.

171
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Saver Tiger was one of them.

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Also, X, which greatly influenced Hide's life.

173
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Hide was biting raw meat at a livehouse.

174
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I thought, "Who is that weirdo?"

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
I didn't want to get very close with him.

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But he was very cool.

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He was chewing raw meat and was very sensual.

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I already knew at that point that he and I would be together.

179
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,000
One of the three major garbage bands in the Kanto region, DEMENTIA.

180
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,500
He had a very fancy makeup, but his personality was quite humble.

181
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But when the performance begins...

182
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,000
Hide's aura was awesome.

183
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I thought, "This guy is crazy".

184
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,000
At that time, Hide said:

185
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Hide said, he hated himself.

186
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
That’s why he created the present Hide.

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,500
And he said that he was worried about whether he could produce Hide well as he imagined himself or not.

188
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,500
He said that Hideto Matsumoto is desperately producing Hide to be more beautiful than anyone.

189
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
He already knew that way at that time.

190
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hideto Matsumoto produces Hide.

191
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,000
The idea has been reflected in subsequent creative activities.

192
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
It's the evidence that there was a character of Hide, back then.

193
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hide is well-known as an artist with double-sideness.

194
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
double-sideness

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
"Hideto Matsumoto produces Hide".

196
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Does that way of thinking lead to the two sides of Hide?

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Flying around in the cranium
Are two worms that resemble me
When they whisper, I can’t refuse.
Are they breeding me? (Breeding)

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The relationship between Hide and Hideto Matsumoto was perfectly that of two sides.

199
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He didn’t mix the two together, right?

200
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
The two couldn’t be one.

201
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,000
He had as many shadows as light.

202
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,500
He was an expressionist himself, but he might have had frustrations and conflicts about that he could not express.

203
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He was a perfectionist but was not perfect.

204
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,500
Thus, he seemed to have always aimed for perfection.

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
He was a very delicate person.

206
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,500
So I had to keep distance from him to be friends with him.

207
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,500
Even if you get acquainted with him, you will not understand the whole world of Hide.

208
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He was not a rock star whose personal life was a mess.

209
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
He took care of very trifling things.

210
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,500
But when he drank, he used to become violent.

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He was spoiled and sincere at the same time.

212
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,000
He was double-faced inside.

213
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,500
There were two worlds within him.

214
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He had a part to enjoy, but sometimes he acted like it was calculated.

215
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,000
“Two-sided” is a word for Hide.

216
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
Hideto Matsumoto, the boy, remains intact.

217
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,000
And Hide was born as a new personality.

218
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Hideto Matsumoto had “rock star Hide” inside.

219
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We shared a lot about music.

220
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,000
But I feel like I did not understand Hide in a human way.

221
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,000
The more I think about it, the more I feel it.

222
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hide’s character was a mask that fascinated people.

223
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
But this may had been the cause for the conflict of mind at times.

224
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I knew that there was someone who was controlling me
from the time I was in elementary school.
It’s not simply about the inside and the outside

225
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
“Saver Tiger”, the starting point of Hide.

226
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Their leap with ideal members.

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
However, there was some hindrance on their way.

228
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Hide’s attitude and mindset seemed to be very irrational to me.

229
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Hide was not going to compromise.

230
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I said, “I can’t accept it, I’ll quit”.

231
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:33,000
Because if I stayed in the band, there would be only conflicts.

232
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hide had confidence in the composition of the members.

233
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
He didn’t want to lose them.

234
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Thus, he made an extreme decision.

235
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
January 28, 1987, Disbandment of Saver Tiger

(The red neon sign says “Rokumeikan” which is the traditional and legendary livehouse)

236
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Hide said that if I leave the band, he would also leave the band, and become a hairdresser.

237
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I said “Never say that”.

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,500
But I didn’t want to reverse my decision.

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When Hide was in Saver Tiger, I asked him to join us but I was rejected.

240
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,500
There was no reason to suddenly stop playing the guitar for a guy who had been enjoying the guitar for so long.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I knew he’d cried a lot.

242
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I received a phone call.

243
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Hide said that he disbanded the band and would quit the music.

244
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But he showed indications of wanting to be together.

245
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I realized that he was still motivated.

246
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,000
At that time, our band was rehearsing.

247
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500
So I asked, “Will you come to see us?”.

248
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,500
He came and watched the rehearsal. He seemed to have a lot of thoughts.

249
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
After that, we went for a drink.

250
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,000
He said “I’m going to join X”.

251
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
We were all surprised and very excited to hear that.

252
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
SEXX GEORGE from LADIESROOM who was the road manager of X at that time.

253
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I really wanted to stop it.

254
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It was tremendously hard for me to manage Yoshiki.

255
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
Then another monster is joining X?

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
February 1987, joining X

257
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Hide was brilliant.

258
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I knew we will have good chemistry.

259
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was convinced of it when Hide came in, even before playing with him.

260
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,000
I thought it would be a new beginning.

261
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Hide called me and said that he joined X.

262
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
I told him “Good for you”.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I guess the reason why Hide called Tetsu.

264
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Hide knew that Tetsu didn’t want him to quit the music.

265
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That’s probably why Hide called.

266
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,200
Hide said that even if Saver Tiger had disappeared, the members would spread like embers.

267
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,500
He told me, “Tetsu, who put a soul in music is about to form a new band."

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,500
"You are going to pursue a splendid rock’n’roll."

269
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,500
And I will take the things that I wanted to show in Saver Tiger to X. And then I’ll change X.”

270
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He said each seed would become four times stronger if dispersed.

271
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
It is an intense reminder of my impression.

272
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,500
X has achieved a higher leap since Hide’s joining.

273
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
X’s influence has grown in the indie scene more and more.

274
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
At that time, Color appeared in the Kansai region.

275
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,500
People used to call it, “X in the east and Color in the west”.

276
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
There was an accident during the live performance.

277
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,000
Japan had a custom, so I suggested to have time for self-restraint.

278
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
But everyone acted as they pleased.

279
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
“Fans want us to keep performing”... claiming like that.

280
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
They didn’t listen to me at all.

281
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I asked Hide what to do.

282
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:10,000
And then he said, “There is the custom in Japan".

283
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,000
"Sometimes you have to follow it.”

284
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,000
He gave me several CDs and said, “How about you do this kind of music?”

285
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Usually people don’t care about other bands like that.

286
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,000
But he said so and I was comforted.

287
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I thought he really cared about me.

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,500
X came out of the indie scene and debuted in the major scene.

289
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It changes the history of Japanese rock scene.

290
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:57,000
In 1992, X was renamed X Japan to advance into the world and moved their base to LA.

291
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
The images that came out from the inside.

292
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The photobook which became the new page of expressionist Hide.

293
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,000
“I don’t need a life-size statue of mine."

294
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,200
"I want to create a photo album that reverses the existing image”

295
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,000
April 1992, released the first photoalbum “Mugongeki”

296
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
He seems to be possessed by something.

297
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
That’s true. He’s possessed. He is running.
He seems to be possessed by something.

298
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
That’s true. He’s possessed. He is running.

299
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Just pressing a button makes him go into the another mode right away.

300
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The man in the straitjacket is staring at something as if he wants to say something.

301
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Is he begging to save him?

302
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,000
Is he wanting to depend on?

303
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,000
Hide’s eyes seemed to say that.

304
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,500
That face still remains in my memory.

305
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,300
In terms of model or subject, he is really the best.

306
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,500
He had the power to go beyond the times.

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He is the person who must be mentioned in the fashion field.

308
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,000
Because he transcended the age.

309
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
サディストの憂鬱 (The Sadist’s Melancholy)
儀信仏 (Buddhist)
双生 (Twins)
自己中心的な静物 (Self-centered still Life)
浄化 (Purification)
鍵 (Key)

310
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Hide’s poem on each page of the photobook “Mugongeki”.

311
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,000
Was there the will for his solo activity hidden in it?

312
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,500
June 13, 1993, Harajuku

313
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
3,000 fans gathered.

314
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Hide decided to do X Japan activities and solo activities at the same time.

315
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The announcement of solo debut.

316
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
He was about to perform “OBLAAT” on the street but it was canceled due to the rainstorm.

317
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Please say anything.

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,500
I wanted to perform. Let them know this.

319
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,500
I wanted to perform.

320
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,000
I really wanted to perform.

321
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,000
I really wanted to perform.

322
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
There is a flood in the upper space.

323
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,300
Is there a flood above?

324
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
There is a fire in the lower space.

325
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,500
There is a fire in the lower space.

326
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
That's it.

327
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,300
That's it.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,500
Let’s stop here.

329
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,500
He said “I’m scared, I’m scared” in a hoarse voice.

330
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He was very nervous because it was the first tour for Hide.

331
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He was very nervous in order to be perfect.

332
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
August 5, 1993, The first single “Eyes Love You” and “50%&50%” were simultaneously released.

333
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
January 21, 1994, The third single “Dice” was released.

334
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
February 23, 1994, The first album “Hide Your Face” was released.

335
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The pop style of “Eyes Love You” was completely different from Hide’s music until that time.

336
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,000
There was a stereotype like “If Hide released something, it would certainly be this style”.

337
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,000
He wanted to break that stereotype.

338
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
“I have a pop tendency as well."

339
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
"I put such a tendency intentionally into the single A side."

340
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
"I want people, even who don’t know about me to enjoy it”.

344
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I participated in his singing practice.

345
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He recorded nearly a thousand times.

346
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,000
He was so troubled by recording too many times.

347
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,000
I told him that he didn’t have to record so many times.

348
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
It was the only advice I ever gave him.

349
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,000
I’m currently singing as a solo.

350
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:57,000
However, when I was an amateur who loved rock music, I really hated vocalists.

351
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,300
They all like to meddle in and want to get attentions.

352
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,700
I thought that none of vocalists were normal.

353
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I thought I was far from vocalists.

354
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:14,500
The way of playing the guitar quietly on one side of the stage was very attractive to me.

355
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,500
That’s why I wanted to be a guitarist.

356
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You can see from the album credit.

357
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,500
It’s written “Voice” instead of “Vocalist” on the album credit.

358
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He seemed to think “I’m not a vocalist yet”.

359
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,500
He was still looking for the directions to go forward.

360

363
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,500

365
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
He would not have planned to invite me to his first tour.

366
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,000
Ran suggested him that Pata should join.
(*Ran(Toshiya Matsukawa) is a guitarist. He was the member for hide FIRST SOLO TOUR '94.)

367
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Then I decided to join.

368
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I didn’t care much about it though.

369
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,500
The first day we met, we drank and went for another round.

370
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We were on our way to another bar.

371
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,000
I didn’t know what the problem was, but Hide was smashing a vending machine.

372
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I stopped him because he was kicking it with his foot.

373
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,500
I asked him if he was upset because it didn't dispense a drink.

374
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,500
He said no, so I asked why he was angry.

375
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,500
He said nothing.

376
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Thus, I said “You idiot. Let’s go!” and dragged him.

377
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,000
And then, I was talking to someone other than Hide at the bar.

378
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Then Hide suddenly stood up to yell, “Am I an idiot?” and hit me.

379
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Later, he called me and said he was sorry.

380
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,500
He said he couldn’t sleep at all and apologized about his behavior.

381
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,500
I said it was okay because it happened while we were drinking and then told him “Let’s drink together again later”.

382
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Then he said “Thank you” and hung up the phone.

383
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:49,300
After a while, he told me about his solo album and said “I’ll tour later so I want you to join us”.

384
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,000
I was an unknown keyboardist at that time.

385
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,500
I was so excited to meet the member of X.

386
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Hide was waiting for me with his sunglasses on.

387
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I had a heartbeat.

388
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,000
I still remember the heartbeat at that time.

389
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,000
I felt like I was going to see the count of Monte Cristo.

390
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,000
I first met him with such tension and excitement.

391
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Hide’s first impression was...

392
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I felt like I saw the bareface of Kabuki actor.

393
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
His skin was very good.

394
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Hide liked Hideyuki.
(* Hideyuki is a guitarist. He was the member of metal band “Schau-Essen”.)

395
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,200
One day, he was seeing Hideyuki on TV.

396
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,000
I was playing behind him then.

397
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,500
He said he’d wanted to be with me since he saw me on TV.

398
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,500
I first met Hide and heard “Yoroshiku”. (*"You are welcome")

399
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Just a handshake with him settled everything.

400
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Normally, they ask me to play (for audition).

401
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But Hide shook hands and said “Yoroshiku”.

402
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,000
The fateful encounter with I.N.A who had been the manipulator of X.

403
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Hide moved I.N.A from the backstage to onstage.

404
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
Hide and I.N.A had a lot in common about music.

405
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,000
So all the songs were made by Hide and I.N.A in collaboration.

406
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,500
“The musician Hide is produced by Hideto Matsumoto and INA”.

407
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hide’s solo activity was spurred through the collaboration.

408
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,000
He said he wanted to make the best team by gathering people he liked.

409
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,100
He invited me to his team.

410
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,500
Instead, he wanted me to exert all my talents only for him.

411
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There were another condition.

412
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,000
He said, if we work together, we have to work on an equal footing.

413
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
He said I should not admire him in order to collaborate.

414
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,500
We could collaborate because it was under those conditions.

415
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
“I.N.A, use all your talents only for me”.

416
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,500
I.N.A who worked as right arm in Hide’s solo activity.

417
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The life of I.N.A has changed drastically by meeting Hide.

418
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I.N.A, use all your talent only for me.

421
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm being swept away and swallowed by rotting and blowing.

I'll tell you who are vomiting the ideal♪

427
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The recording of X was over while we were preparing for a live performance.

428
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,000
Hide decided to stay with X and I came back to our rehearsal room.

429
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,300
There were only people I saw for the first time.

430
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,500
Hide said, “Do something with them until I get back”.

431
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,500
So I tried to practice with them.

432
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,300
But we’ve all just met and shook hands.

433
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,600
We were not friends.

434
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,500
People came into the rehearsal room one by one asking “Is this the studio?”

435
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I.N.A was sitting here, me and D.I.E were sitting there.

436
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Then I.N.A said, “Chirolyn, play 16 bars by slapping” as if he were a teacher.

437
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
I thought “What the hell is that guy?”

438
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,000
After that, Hide came back and listened to what we were doing.

439
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
He was very angry. “What’s this? You’ve done nothing until now.”

440
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Most members didn’t memorize the songs.

441
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Of course, I was one of them.

442
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
When I was told “Next song is... ”, then I wore headphones and copied it in secret.

443
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,000
“Pata, you didn’t practice at all”

444
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,500
He got drunk and released his stress out.

445
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The fight started with “Why is your hair red?”.

446
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,000
We seized each other’s collar and caused a disturbance.

447
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,000
I think that Hide was a person who was clumsy in human relationships.

448
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,000
After fighting, I felt more comfortable with him.

449
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,000
Maybe because I felt in my heart that I wanted to forgive him.

450
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,500
On second thought, I feel as if I was deceived by him.

451
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
When we were rehearsing for the first time together, Hide said, “I’m sorry that I like rehearsals”.

452
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,000
He was worried when we were rehearsing.

453
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I asked him “Do we have to do so much rehearsal?”

454
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,500
At that time, Tetsu asked me, “Have you heard Hide’s solo songs?”.

455
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I answered “Not yet”, and he said “The songs are very Hide”.

456
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
When I stretch out my hand, it drifts away.

457
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,000
A reward of vanity, wasted and released libido.

458
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,000
The meaning of existence at the end of long suffering.

459
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,000
Me, in the mirror crying to let him know.

460
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:15,000
Let me water the dried flower of yours, if the flower doesn’t end.

461
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Will the flower bloom or rot?

462
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,000
Dice with only two results.

463
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Let the flower bloom as you think, before it is torn up and wilted.

464
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Someday the bud becomes a flower.

465
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,500
I'll tell you who is spitting yesterday.

466
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Once and for all dice away, dice away

467
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,000
HIDE as a member of X Japan, and hide as a solo singer.

468
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
X members decided they would do solo activities, and then the recording company said, “If you do, your albums will sell well”.

469
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Hide was offended by that words.

470
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,000
“Mine sells well? No matter what I do?"

471
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,000
"What does it mean? That’s not music. I don’t want to do those things.”

472
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,000
He had such a conflict.

473
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Unfold the trick in your hand.

474
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Seeds in oil which smell bad enough to be expressed.

475
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,500
If it sprouts, it will be your wonderful dinner.

476
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The remaining food is scattered and rolling here and there.

477
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Take me trash!

478
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
At that time, hide became aware of himself who had got caught up in commercialism.

479
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
‘What am I doing?’.

480
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,000
“DOUBT” was born in anger of himself.

481
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,700
Hide swore to keep singing “DOUBT” so that he would not forget his mind of that moment.

482
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,500
Hey gentlemen! Is the water there so sweet?

483
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,000
Gentleman, try some musty diamonds.

484
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
Doubt, doubt, doubt you.

485
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,000
Flesh are cut and bones are broken.

486
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,000
Doubt, doubt, doubt you.

487
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Tuning of rabies singer.

488
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Doubt, doubt, doubt you.

489
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,000
Flesh are cut and bones are broken.

490
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Doubt, doubt, doubt you.

491
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,000
Don’t you realize that you are surrounded by enemies?

492
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:19,500
During the live performance, he realized that he was singing and talking to himself in childhood.

493
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I felt it during the live performance.

494
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
This guy has been wanting to do something like this.

495
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Even though I am exposed to the shiny wind, I’m gazing at me that can not be melt.

496
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:47,000
Not even showing the way I walk, the outline becomes clear.

497
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:59,000
The body dancing in illusion is the pantomime, which is the opposite of my mind.

498
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The reason to fill up wounds with something is only for me to be myself.

499
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Tell me, somebody tell me, please tell me.

500
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Even with voiceless words.

501
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,000
Tell me, somebody tell me, please tell me.

502
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Your voice has not arrived yet.

503
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Even though I look for distorted love, it is answerless and meaningless, I’m just greedy.

504
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,000
My own voice is being swept away.

505
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,500
I can’t hear it until it becomes ashes.

506
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Tell me, somebody tell me, please tell me.

507
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Who is covering my eyes?

508
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Tell me, somebody tell me, please tell me.

509
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
My eyes are looking at you.

510
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,500
"I’ve never sang a song about the society."

511
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
"I’ve been singing songs only about my personal story."

512
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
"The theme of this album is ‘initial impulse’."

513
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,500
"The first listener was myself in childhood."

514
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,500
"So it’s a very private album."

515
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If you do not get away from you of those days, you will not find the answer.

516
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,700
Hide, who has thought that he would not find answers unless he gets away from his childhood.

517
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
At the age of 29, however, he wrote to himself in childhood.

518
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
<To Another Myself, Beyond the Space and Time>

519
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:30,000
To the boy, Hideto Matsumoto

Actually I made an album. The theme is “Initial Impulse”.
I think I made it well.
Probably, this album was created for you.
Do you remember the moment you suddenly changed?
Yeah, I’m talking about the moment when you first met rock music.
I think that you felt in those days and that I feel today is the same.
This album was made to confirm it.

520
00:44:31,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I really wonder.
Why were we so excited?
It’s no exaggeration to say that I have been traveling over a decade to find the answer since I broke up with you.
If I break up with you like this again,
I don’t think I can find the answer.
In hindsight, the answer seems to have existed only at the moment when I was with you.
So I’m going backwards for decades when I was being separated from you.
If you tell me that you have the same feeling I found on this journey,
I think I’ll be able to keep going on this journey that I can’t see the end yet.

521
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
One of the staff said:

522
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,000
"When the live performance was over, I was often called to the rooftop of the hotel by hide."

523
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,000
"On the rooftop, hide used to look at the distant landscape without any special words."

524
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,500
"His breathing back was impressive."

525
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,000
Thank you. Thank you for staff’s efforts.

526
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,000
Thank gods of rock!

527
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,500
Good bye!

528
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
alcohol

529
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Once I start drinking, I drink a lot.

530
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
No more!

531
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:10,000
When I first met him, he just drank beer at best.

532
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I blacked out when I’ve drunk the most.

533
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,500
Maybe I drank two bottles of sake.

534
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Finally!

535
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,000
He threw a cigarette lighter into a driving taxi. Boom!

536
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,000
So the taxi stopped making a noise. We shouted “No, no, no, no, no, no!”

537
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He got drunk again in Sapporo.

538
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
He was hitting the door of the hotel room making a noise.

539
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,000
That was my room.

540
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,000
I barely avoided the signboard that Hide was wielding.

541
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,000
I didn’t go out of the room because Hide seemed to be completely drunk.

542
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,000
I looked out through the door view and he was rioting.

543
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,000
He suddenly picked up a fire extinguisher and hit the door of my room.

544
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,000
I was really scared.

545
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,500
bang! bang! The door was about to fall off its hinges.

546
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
So I blocked the door from the inside.

547
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
After a while, he went back to his room.

548
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,500
This is what I heard later, but they said that Hide threw many things at the window.

549
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,500
Later, Pata told me.

550
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
If that happens again, I don’t need to hesitate to open the door.

551
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,800
Hide will just look around the room and will go back.

552
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,000
I said “If you are going to go on the rampage here, go back”.

553
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,000
He never acted violently when he was with me.

554
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
I saw his rampage a lot.

555
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
He used to apologize the next day.

556
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
He asked me to forgive him, even though he didn’t recall what had happened.

557
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
In hindsight, he was gentle for the degree he was drunk.

558
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,000
He seemed to go on the rampage under the calculation.

559
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,000
Even if he got drunk and rages, he kept being nervous.

560
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,500
brothers

561
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
HIDE hid his hard work and his weak side.

562
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,000
Weak side...hmm... How should I say it?

563
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,800
He didn’t reveal his true feelings.

564
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,000
He seemed to have tacitly told me not to get any closer.

565
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
A counterpart who doesn’t reveal his true feelings.

566
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And his brother Hiroshi Matsumoto who became a manager of Hide without knowing anything.

567
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,000
At first, I was so nervous that I couldn’t sleep well.

568
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,000
He said “You should tell me everything”.

569
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Sometimes I was hit the back of my head with hard shoe by him.

570
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
About six times. While I was driving.

571
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,000
The reason was that I greet in a small voice.

572
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,300
The greeting like “Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu!”.

573
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,000
He said “This industry is stricter than it looks. Do it properly!”

574
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Hide’s attitude toward Hiroshi was sometimes too severe.

575
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:13,000
Hide didn’t want people would think that he gave Hiroshi preferential treatment because Hiroshi was his brother.
(*in charge of protecting Hide that time)

576
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,000
He wouldn’t have been able to treat Hiroshi, who had no knowledge of the music industry, more than just as an errand boy.

577
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:27,000
He seemed to draw Hiroshi into the music industry little by little.

578
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:37,000
I think that Hide, in some ways, felt his younger brother was really close to him.

579
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,000
While he was supposed to live as hide, Hiroshi would be the only place where he could stay as Matsumoto Hideto.

580
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
The counterpart whom hide could reveal his bare face.

581
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,000
"I hope that my brother will grow up to be my colleague."

582
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
"For the future looked ahead."

583
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,500
For the future looked ahead.

584
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,000
Hide’s activities became more various.

585
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,000
The label established by Hide, LEMONeD.

586
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,500
"I’m not a producer, but a collector."

587
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
"If you have something fun, bring it with you."

588
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,500
"I want to make a label like a toy box containing everything."

589
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,000
kowai + kawaii = kowaii
The combination of “kowai(怖い:scary)” and “kawaii(可愛い:cute)”, the new word “kowaii” became its concept.

590
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
While designing the stuffs for LEMONeD, he developed clothing business and opened design shops and beauty shops.

591
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
He said he was going to seek a new office and told me to go with him.

592
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:48,000
Hide said, “We can do whatever here because it’s a shopping mall”.

593
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,200
And he asked me “Emi Chan, Would you like to do something here?”

594
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:57,000
I replied, “Shall we sell juice here? Because the name of the shop is LEMONeD”.

595
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:03,000
I jokingly said to him, but he told me “Yes, go ahead”.

596
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,000
I told him that I wanted to run a beauty salon and he allowed me to do it.

597
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,000
When I opened the shop, the number of customers didn’t increase.

598
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,000
Hide said, “Be more active”.

599
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
So I answered, “Yes, Sir”

600
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
< On August 26, 1997, hide presents MIX LEMONeD JELLY >
The club event hosted by LEMONeD was held.

601
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,500
The days when the internet was not yet available.

602
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,300
They decided to broadcast the event of four places simultaneously via the internet.

603
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,000
The event that surpassed the era.

604
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,000
It may look common nowadays, but it was a revolutionary idea for those days.

605
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,000
The plan originated with Hide.

606
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
LEMONeD established by HIDE.

607
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,000
A meeting with a band was the occasion for the establishment of this label.

608
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:11,000
One of the bands whose life has changed drastically due to the encounter with HIDE, ZEPPET STORE.

609
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:17,000
They had been releasing their self-produced CDs before the debut in the major scene.

610
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,000
Hide accidentally heard the CDs.

611
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,600
“I realized the mission given to me besides music”.

612
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I felt as if the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle was put in place.

613
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I thought it’s a kind of opportunity or encounter to hear the songs that convey the feeling of composer.

614
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:49,000
[♪ GOOD BYE] Please songs tell me true, your melody, no matter where I am ♪

615
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,000
The road to major debut.

616
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,000
Hide was different from other companies that only talked about business.

617
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,000
He said that we had a future because our music was awesome.

618
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,000
[♪ GOOD BYE] I'll walk softly♪

619
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,000
Once Hide has fought his staff because of us.

620
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:23,000
He heard from the staff that Zeppet Store was not commercially viable.

621
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:28,500
"If you don’t know how to sell, try to like them".

622
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
"Listen to their music until you really like theirs".

623
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:43,000
Hide exploded with fury and hit the wall to make a hole.

624
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,400
He told the staff “You’re fired”.

625
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,000
I was looking at them vacantly.

626
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,000
He looked so disappointed.

627
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:00,700
He was angry but somehow looked disappointed.

628
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,000
We were happy to see him like that though.

629
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Hide made Zeppet Store debut and decided to tour the US at the same time.

630
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:20,000
Looking back, he wanted it himself for sure.

631
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,000
Because Hide let us tour with his own money.

632
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,000
May 1996

633
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Zeppet Store!

634
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:48,800
He would have been very proud to see Zeppet Store appealed to American audience.

635
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,000
“Hey, did you see? How are they?” to American audience.

636
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
“Japanese are really awesome, aren’t they?”

637
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:01,000
He seemed to want to appeal those things.

638
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,000
So he kept talking about such things.

639
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:12,500
He suddenly ran out, climbed into the car and knocked as if he were shouting “Go get'em!”

640
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:19,000
He ran out shouting and said, “Kimura, I have night blindness so I can’t see ahead well”.

641
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,000
Hide jumped off the car and asked “Have you lost anything?”

642
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Because Seiji got drunk as well, he replied “No” in a drunken voice.

643
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,000
“Yeahhhh!”

644
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,000
When we stopped the car with excitement, the staff’s car crashed into ours. Boom!

645
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:37,000
Not the staff of Hide’s company but the owner of a sushi restaurant came.

646
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,000
The owner of the sushi restaurant said “Hey! Hide, what are you doing?”

647
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Hide got off the car, saying “I’m sorry”.

648
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We decided to stop the frenzy and go back gently.

649
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,500
On our way back, Zeppet Store’s song came on the radio.

650
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,600

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
YEAHHHH!!!!!

658
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
It’s mind-blowing!

659
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,300
This is it!

660
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,200
Good! Let’s go!

661
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,000
I’ll drive.

662
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
No, it's dangerous.

663
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Let’s die like this!

664
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
No, no!

665
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
We have to perform tomorrow morning.

666
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I think Hide was incredibly touched at that moment.

667
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,500
He shed tears of joy and kept cheering us on.

668
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,000
Who else would be such a person?

669
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Hide has produced a number of bands besides Zeppet Store.

670
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:15,500
He discovered us while creating the music he wanted to do.

671
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
“Do you want to release an album?”

672
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,000
It was also Hide who introduced us to Yoshiki.

673
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:37,000
He was a senpai, an older brother, and parents to us.

674
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,500
(* the name of a band)

675
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There were kouhais who have been discovered by hide but could not meet him.
(*kouhai = older colleague)

676
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,500
(*also the name of a band)

677
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
“At that time, they were discovered by Hide while they were active in the name of TRANSTIC NERVE”.

678
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,300
It’s been 15 years since we made our debut.

679
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:08,500
And I think the reason why we can continue to perform as a band is because of the promise we made at that time.

680
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,500
We have run without hiatus until now because we think hide is watching us.

681
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,000
It’s a sense of mission.

682
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,000
Well, he said our music was awesome.

683
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:30,000
The word that he told us “awesome” is more precious than any other word.

684
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,000
Even though we couldn’t face him directly, we think this is also a kind of an encounter.

685
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:44,000
So we are doing as a band believing that he is always watching us.

686
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
There are countless musicians influenced by Hide.

687
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
June 1996. The production of 2nd album “PSYENCE”

688
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,000
"I felt that the songs I made last year were crappy."

689
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,000
"I deleted the parts that would be better to replace."

690
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,500
The improvisational parts and the theoretical parts.

691
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Speaking of his double-sidedness, he had an impromptu part and a theoretical part.

692
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:26,000
For example, there was a time when we heard different sounds due to computer data problems.

693
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,000
When he heard that, he said, “What’s this? It’s stunning!”

694
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,300
And he asked me to analyze the reason why it sounds cool.

695
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:40,000
After this process of analysis, we can have our new techniques available for later use.

696
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:49,000
Along with this theoretical part, he put emphasis on the attitude of “If it sounds good to me, then I value it as good.”

697
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,000
Ability to absorb various things into himself was really awesome.

698
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
September 2, 1996, The release of 2nd album “PSYENCE”

699
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,500
<s>

The event to announce “PSYENCE” was very unique that not only musicians but also various performers gathered.</s>

700
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:30,000
The event to announce “PSYENCE” was very unique that not only musicians but also various performers gathered.

701
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,000
[♪ POSE] The meaning of today that only God knows is overlapped with yesterday.

702
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:57,000
I’m holding my head that I can’t break.

703
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I know.

704
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I’ll nail it, dear my sun who never sink.

705
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,500
I’m grateful for today and build up stones.

706
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,700
Tell me why.

707
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
He was quite nervous when he started his second album activity.

708
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,000
Because he started with a different concept than his first album.

709
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,000
I noticed that he couldn’t hide the nervousness.

710
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:31,500
He has been a person who kept on amazing and entertaining people since he released his first album.

711
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,500
But he became different when he released his second album.

712
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,500
It was not hide who put band X in the background.

713
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Because he established the style of solo singer Hide, the breadth of his music has expanded.

714
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:51,000
He was free from the constraints of his hands and feet.

715
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,000
[♪ POSE]: Everythin' POSE. POSE Everythin' POSE.

716
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:04,000
September 4, 1996, Hide’s solo tour “PSYENCE Go Go” has began.

717
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,000
He was an expressionist.

718
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:30,000
He was not a mere player, but he was the person who enjoyed creating and expressing himself.

719
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,500
He would have enjoyed the solo activity for sure.

720
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,500
Unexpectedly, he went onstage without the guitar.

721
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I was very surprised.

722
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,000
He had a very objective point of view.

723
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,000
He objectively analyzed the activities of his 1st album and planned the 2nd album activity to be without the guitar.

724
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:15,500
It is surprising that he has abandoned the guitar even though he was originally a guitarist.

725
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,000
He was not tied to being a guitarist.

726
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,000
At that point, he was already an artist.

727
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:31,000
He rehearsed again and again and began to think that it would be okay to do without guitar.

728
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,500
It’s certainly true.

729
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,500
He gradually gave up playing the guitar.

730
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
He was not simply aiming to discard the guitar.

731
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,500
I think that he wanted to convey the songs and lyrics clearly.

732
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,500
When he finished his 1st album tour and began working on the 2nd album,

733
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I think he’s got the confidence as a vocalist.

734
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:06,700
For him, that was also a way of expressing himself, rather than he thought “I became a vocalist”.

735
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:14,500
The fact that he heightened the key of the songs is the proof that he fell into singing.

736
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I’d not thought he was poor at singing until then,

737
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,000
but at that time I thought “He became a vocalist” for the first time.

738
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:31,000
When he was a member of X, he was allowed to be a strange guitarist in the band.

739
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,000
But when he was soloing, he had to fascinate people himself.

740
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,000
At that time, he found something completely new inside.

741
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:45,000
He found the answer on the way, rather than he had the answer from the start.

742
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Can I sing tomorrow?

743
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,000
It’ll be okay.

744
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,500
Good morning.

745
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,500
Place staffs at the exit so they can not find the exit.

746
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The skills of the staff also improved responding to Hide’s demands.

747
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:15,000
However, hide’s performances were not created self-righteously.

748
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,500
He always valued the staff’s opinions.

749
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Okay, do it.

750
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Can I do it? Thank you very much.

751
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
He completed his ideas by sharing opinions with members and staffs.

752
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,100
Even if it takes more time, please place the upper cameras as a peeping angle from the top.

753
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,200
Don’t pierce holes.

754
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,500
Do not pierce holes for the side cameras as well.

755
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,800
Just take it from the side please.

756
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Making things with colleagues.

757
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,500
Trust - to obtain purpose

758
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I’m not sure if he knew how to draw people’s talents or he just did it unconsciously.

759
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,000
Anyway his ability to bring out people’s talents was amazing.

760
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,500
He would have been watching everyone on tour.

761
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:28,000
He would have been quietly watching the staff so they didn’t feel like they were being watched by him.

762
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:35,000
Hide was able to get people to work for him and follow his decisions, not for the good business prospects.

763
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Simply because he had that kind of charm.

764
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:47,200
If someone asks if Hide was a man of virtue, you can answer “Yes, Certainly”.

765
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,700
Even though he was not a saint.

766
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:55,000
He firmly trusted people and entrusted them with work.

767
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:04,800
He worked with the staff that way, so all the staff presented their idea voluntarily.

768
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,000
He asked the members to come forward.

769
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
He told the members that they could stand in front of him on stage.

770
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
He used the same vehicles and hotels as the members.

771
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:25,000
Hide has often told us that the staff are those who does the same things as him.

772
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Usually the staff and singer use different hotels.

773
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,500
But Hide always stayed with the staff.

774
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,000
[♪Hi-Ho] I love your phrase.

775
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:55,000
The code broken due to my bad feeling is playing a sweet and sad love song.

776
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:03,000
Like a cartoon with a broken balance, your everyday life is not organized.

777
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:17,500
Happy days & Happy nights full of things I don’t care.

778
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Hi-Ho! I like your world full of wasteful things.

779
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:36,000
If you don’t mind, let’s take trivial brats with us.

780
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Getting wet with you, obscene and cool tone...

781
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,000
I felt I had lost the initiative.

782
01:10:52,300 --> 01:11:01,600
Hide made what he wanted to sound clearly and expressed it in live performances.

783
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:10,000
I was part of his accomplishment, but I felt a little bitter.

784
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
[♪Hi-Ho] A song that doesn’t really matter, a trash-like scenario.

785
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I’m dancing to a crappy song.

786
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:33,000
The victory of your attraction that is not mixed even though it’s idling.

787
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:41,000
I love your world full of only useless things.

788
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,000
If you don’t mind, let’s dance with useless us.

789
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,500
It was a whole new world of his.

790
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,500
I was astonished.

791
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,500
There was a tremendous evolution between the 1st album and the 2nd album.

792
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I didn’t think it was unexpected.

793
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,000
I knew Hide was into pop.

794
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
He wanted to express the feeling of being merged into one.

795
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:31,000
He seems to have wanted to take out the things from his drawer and play music named Hide.

796
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,000
His second album properly expressed the feeling.

797
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,000
Now, let me take a picture.

798
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Hide’s antenna was extended from Japan to the world.

799
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:59,000
The second solo album and zilch album “3.2.1” were produced almost at the same time.

800
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Ray McVeigh, formerly a supporting member of Sex Pistols.

801
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,000
Paul Raven, who was a member of Killing Joke.

802
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:18,700
A band that formed with the two, hide’s challenge to the world, it was zilch.

803
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,500
I was a little bitter.

804
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,500
Because we also wanted to challenge the world stage.

805
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:32,000
After listening to the CD, however, I was convinced that Hide was being already accepted in the world.

806
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,000
He said he was very nervous at that time.

807
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,000
He said "If this doesn’t work, it’s hopeless."

808
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:44,500
"I feel like I have a hunch now."

809
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,000
However, the release date that hide wanted was lost due to contract issues.

810
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:07,000
If zilch’s album was released worldwide just in time, I believe the terrain of the world music has changed.

811
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:17,200
He advanced crushing a multitude of things to reach that position.

812
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:26,000
His effort until then was great.

813
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Hide discovered the strength of the Japanese through the activities of zilch.

814
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,500
He was confident that he could produce equal results (as westerners).

815
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:43,500
“We Japanese also have the strength to compete with the world”.

816
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
"I don’t want to conceal the fact that it was produced by Japanese".

817
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:55,000
I wanted to let them know the beauty and the fun of Japanese when it becomes music.

818
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:02,500
I believe I won if there is no sense of incongruity despite I set Japanese lyrics to heavy rock on purpose.

819
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,500
Whether I sing in Japanese or English, I want to make sure there is no difference in sound.

820
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,500
In a word, it is something to deliver.

821
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,500
I know that if the listeners are English speakers, I need to make it in English.

822
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,200
But I want to let them know that it was originally made by Japanese.

823
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:34,000
I want to share the unique complexity and beauty of Japanese with them.

824
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,000
Taking the complexity and beauty of Japanese as a basis for songs.

825
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,000
"I never think that Japanese isn’t suitable for the tone of rock."

826
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:53,000
"I would like to write Japanese lyrics that have a taste of words that even foreigners can feel magnificence."

827
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,500
Hide’s will is reflected in his third album, “Ja, Zoo”.

828
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Hide and I.N.A embarked on the production of the songs.

829
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Hide, who was speeding up, but after a few month...

830
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
September 22, 1997, X Japan disbandment announcement

831
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It was right after the press conference that announced the disbandment of X.

832
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,000
Fans who saw TV gathered.

833
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,000
I was driving slowly through the crowded fans.

834
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,000
I thought hide would open the window and say something to them.

835
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,500
But he was not seen in the rearview mirror.

836
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Looking back, he was lying in the back seat.

837
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,000
"Go faster! How can I show my face to them at this time?"

838
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:59,000
"Go faster! I’m not able to face them".

839
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:06,500
He decided not to make fans sad, but he couldn’t keep the promise himself.

840
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He said he was really bitter because he betrayed fans.

841
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,000
At the press conference, fans were gathering in front of the hotel.

842
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,000
We passed the place and went to Hide’s house.

843
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,000
And there we made “Rocket Dive” together.

844
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
I remember the day.

845
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,000
Of course we couldn’t finish it.

846
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
“INA chan, let’s stop today”.

847
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
After that he went out somewhere.

848
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,000
Hide’s regular bar Rally, where he used to drink with his colleagues every night.

849
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,500
After the press conference, he came to the bar alone.

850
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
After talking this and that, he finally cried.

851
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:09,000
At that time, Hide found his direction as he began his solo career,

852
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:16,000
so I thought he would finish X and commit to soloing.

853
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,000
I couldn’t understand why he was crying.

854
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:28,500
In hindsight, hide had a deep affection for the band.

855
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:41,000
For hide, X was the band that couldn’t be better.

856
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:47,000
The band would have been like a family or home to him.

857
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:54,000
If someone said “former X member Hide”, he was very angry. “Not former!”

858
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
After crying for a long time, hide showed a smiling face talking about the future.

859
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
December 31, 1997 X Japan The Last Live

860
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
The day after the X Japan The Last Live

861
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
January 1, 1998

862
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,000
Hide started his activity as “Hide with Spread Beaver”.

863
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
[♪Rocket Dive] It’s generally similar everyday, but it’s OK in its own way.

864
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,500
However, somehow I look up the sky.

865
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
January 28, 1998 “Rocket Dive” Release

866
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
[♪Rocket Dive] Boys & Girls who totally fell into a reverie.

867
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,500
They laugh after their mind was read.

868
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,000
But it’s not true.

869
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,000
Hide said “Rocket Dive” was a song that was once held off.

870
01:20:53,500 --> 01:21:03,500
At that time, he needed to encourage the fans who had gone through X’s disbandment,

871
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,500
so he decided to work on the song again.

872
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,500
He worked on “Rocket Dive” around the time of disbandment press conference.

873
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So the contents of the lyrics reflect the fans that hide saw.

874
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:26,000
I felt his strong intention in order to give pleasure to the fans who were wandering.

875
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I think that’s the message of Rocket Dive.

876
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,000
[♪Rocket Dive] You may feel so empty.

877
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:40,000
There is nothing, which means there is anything.

878
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,000
You can go anywhere, wherever you want to go.

879
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:50,000
A soaring rocket, launch before it rusts.

880
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:58,000
Until then, he used to make something inside of himself into messages and then work off into the songs.

881
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,000
But Rocket Dive gave him a chance for change.

882
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,000
[♪Rocket Dive] When you start flying, you are a perfect rocket.

883
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Come on! space age baby rocket dive.

884
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,500
Bungy dive to an invisible place.

885
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,000
Into a universe where new stars twinkling.

886
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,500
Sail away.

887
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,500
I asked him what the “Spread Beaver” means.

888
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,500
He then said “It means this”.

889
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So I said “What? Why did you make such an embarrassing name?”

890
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
And he said “I wanted to make the most embarrassing name”.

891
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:39,000
When someone used the word “workplace”, then he got angry and yelled “It’s not a workplace!”.

892
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,000
Hide had a strong desire to have a band.

893
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,000
He said “You guys are a band. You are not my session musicians”.

894
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,000
He said it was a good idea to give our band a name.

895
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,000
He said there’s nothing to change because we were a band from the start.

896
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,000
We were promoted from our perspective.

897
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,000
Until then we’d been supporting players, but we finally became members of the band.

898
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,000
I really became a member of the band.

899
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
[♪Rocket Dive] I want to fly to an invisible place.

900
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,000
High-speeding you are a moment’s spark.

901
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,500
I will continue with rock music in the future.

902
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:17,000
< The reason I play rock music  >

903
01:23:17,001 --> 01:23:18,500
And it’s like a master’s mindset.

904
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I also belong to Spread Beaver.

905
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:25,000
< I belong to Spread Beaver >

I also belong to Spread Beaver.

906
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,500
[♪Rocket Dive] Into a universe where new stars twinkling.

907
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,300
Sail away

908
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:36,000
“This year, I will fly like a rocket”. Hide said so.

909
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
hide with Spread Beaver and X Japan.

910
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,000
I can’t even compare, basically.

911
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:57,000
There was a boss called Yoshiki in the band X.

912
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:06,000
So when I was in X, I freely played the guitar depending on the attraction of Yoshiki.

913
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,800
I was very pleased with the title of a “weird guitarist”.

914
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But now things are totally different.

915
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,000
I have to care everything and have to do a lot of different things.

916
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:25,000
We used to share all the achievements in X, so one-fifth of the power was assigned to me.

917
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,000
But now, I have to exert my power 100%.

918
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,800
When I get tired, I get tired 100%.

919
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,500
When I lose, I lose 100%.

920
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,500
When I win, I win 100%.

921
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,500
Producing of the 3rd album “Ja, Zoo”.

922
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
< April, 1998 Los Angeles >
Pseudo rock star!

923
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
He evolved the experience he obtained through the 2nd album “PSYENCE”.

924
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,000
The word created by Hide, “Psyborg Rock”.

925
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:07,500
The base of the album “Psyborg Rock” existed in the 2nd album “PSYENCE” already.

926
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:15,000
After disassembling each note played by a human, they reassembled it and stacked it up in several layers.

927
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,000
Then they mixed their computer-generated music with this.

928
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:23,000
Psyborg rock meant that the tone of human and machine were fused together.

929
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,500
The style created with I.N.A.

930
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Formally I was soloing while I was belonging to X.

931
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,000
I was a solo singer without a band.

932
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,000
Since I didn’t have members, I became dependent on the machine.

933
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:47,000
When I sing and play the guitar, the computer aids, that was the way I envisioned.

934
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:51,000
We proceeded in that way and eventually reached here.

935
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,000
We already used that method a lot when we worked on the first album.

936
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,000
We sampled the phrases of the guitar.

937
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:03,000
Pressing each keyboard key causes a recorded guitar phrase to sound.

938
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,000
We made songs by playing this keyboard.

939
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,000
We’ve been experimenting with such a variety of things.

940
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,300
It’ll not change much.

941
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:21,000
Rock music will continue to be played through human groups and machine groups.

942
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:32,000
According to the genre classification in Japan, it’s called “Visual Rock”, but visual rock doesn’t mean music.

943
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:38,000
So I wanted to declare it a “Psyborg Rock”.

944
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,000
It’s still questionable if this is a music genre.

945
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:46,000
I’m making noise that it will be fun if this becomes trend.

946
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:55,500
Hide has an international mindset that is not limited to Japan.

947
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
He is working in Japan because he is a Japanese.

948
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:07,500
But I think he will be successful enough if he release albums here.

949
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:14,500
I let my colleagues listen to his music, they were all surprised a lot.

950
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:22,400
Overall, it’s not much different from the previous two albums.

951
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:30,000
I think I achieved some of the goals I wanted to achieve in this album.

952
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:39,500
I think this album will strongly show the fusion of my aspiration as a singer and the rock music I wanted to do.

953
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
The future spread in front of him

954
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:46,000
One night, only me and Hide drank without other people for the first time.

955
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,500
Growth of younger brother.

956
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:58,000
It was the time to achieve recognition as the aide to Hide and to share the plan for the future.

957
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:06,400
Hide said “Be my spokesperson so you can speak equally to me”.

958
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,500
I was surprised when I heard that.

959
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,500
Hide would have kept it in his mind.

960
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I speculate that he had a harsh whip on Hiroshi because he wanted his brother to be his spokesperson someday.

961
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:28,500
Zilch had been trying to do overseas activities since then, hide with Spread Beaver had also been on the rise.

962
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:38,000
“We are going to be very busy because I am aiming for overseas activities”.

963
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:46,500
He said that he couldn’t fight unless he had the carefully selected staff.

964
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Until then, Hide was the president and the artist.

965
01:29:53,300 --> 01:30:02,000
But from then on he decided to quit the president job and concentrate on the artist job, namely hide’s works.

966
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:11,500
He didn’t ask me to be the president, but said “Stand in front of people as my spokesperson”.

967
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:18,000
Artist and manager, older brother and younger brother.

968
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,500
The person he can show his bare face.

969
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
“Be my spokesperson”

970
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,000
Hide almost reached the future he always had dreamed of.

971
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:42,000
May 13th, 1998. release

972
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,000
“Pink Spider” was released following “Rocket Dive”.

973
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,000
The lyrics have storytelling.

974
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:54,000
The “Pink Spider” means a spider that caresses the delusion.

975
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:59,000
Web spinned by spiders is “web” in English.

976
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:06,000
Web is the best way for us to gain information.

977
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,500
The internet is an example.

978
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That’s how the spider that spewed the web to collect information should live only in the web that he created.

979
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:26,000
The spider who doesn’t know other world is deluding himself that the web he spinned is the source of information.

980
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,400
It is a story of a man who is trapped in a delusion and doesn’t know outside.

981
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,700
At last, the spider longs for clouds and flies to another world called sky.

982
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
He admires the clouds and ascends to the sky.

983
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:43,000
In fact, clouds are only a component of the sky.

984
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,500
After all, the spider ends up becoming just a part of the sky.

985
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,800
I asked him, "Did you borrow the lyrics from a tale?"

986
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
"If not, is there a model of the lyrics?"

987
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,500
He didn’t answer.

988
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It seemed that he didn’t want to answer, so I tried to change the topic.

989
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,500
Then, about 5 seconds later, he said “It’s my story”.

990
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,500
My new single “Pink Spider” that is scheduled to be released on May 23th.

991
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,800
[♪Pink Spider] You put a thread of lies on all sides.

992
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,500
You believed your little world was the whole world.

993
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,500
You hurt everyone that comes near you.

994
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
You mistake the sky would be square.

995
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,500
“This is all... Everything is like this anyway, isn’t it?”

996
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You said that and that’s a lie.

997
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:10,500
Because your loud appearance looked lonely, a bird of paradise talked to you strangely.

998
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
“Eat butterfly’s wings and come over, to paradise”

999
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:20,000
“Up there, you may do as you please”.

1000
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
“I want to go”

1001
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
“I want wings”.

1002
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:38,000
You ignore the desperate plea of the captured butterfly and are just staring at the sky.

1003
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:44,500
"It is not that I hurt you because I hate you".

1004
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:58,000
"It is just because I have no wings and the sky is too high".

1005
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
"Use my wings, Spider."

1006
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:09,000
"You don’t know the painfulness of eternal flying as of now."

1007
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:18,000
"But someday, you’ll realize that you’ve been flying only in someone’s hands, and you have called it freedom".

1008
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Can’t fly well with the borrowed wings, falling headlong.

1009
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,500
“It’s over now”

1010
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,500
“Even though I can see the sky”

1011
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
“It is a failure”

1012
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
“I wish I had wings...”

1013
01:35:48,500 --> 01:36:14,000
Beyond the barely visible sky, birds are heading south “Let’s fly again, cutting these threads off, with my own jet engine, when that cloud passes by...”

1014
01:36:20,000 --> 01:35:29,500
Pink Spider, the sky is calling me, Pink Spider

1015
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:41,000
(( In japanese, spider[クモ : kumo] and cloud[雲 : kumo] are homonyms.
It’s interesting that kumo(spider) admires kumo(cloud) and becomes kumo[cloud] ))

1016
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,500
Hide came back from LA where he stayed for a long time for promotion.

1017
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That night, he finished the recording of a TV show and took part in a wrap-up party as always.

1018
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:02,000
The mood was heightening with his colleagues who have met in a long time.

1019
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:07,000
That night, he talked about the future of “hide with Spread Beaver”.

1020
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:16,000
Anecdotes about TV appearance and performance, schedule of tour, things to do as a band, thought about members...

1021
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
"I wanna live as a band member."

1022
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
"I wanna keep going with my band".

1023
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,500
I thought someone tried to fool me.

1024
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So I decided to come back to Japan.

1025
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,500
I couldn’t believe it.

1026
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I thought there might be a conspiracy.

1027
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,000
I hoped it would be a conspiracy.

1028
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
< May 2, 1998, Sudden accident by doing cervical vertebra traction treatment during drunkenness >
It was an accident at home.

1029
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:05,500
< May 2, 1998, Sudden accident by doing cervical vertebra traction treatment during drunkenness >

1030
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:21,000
After driving him home that day, why didn’t I ever think of going up to his place?

1031
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
The situation would have changed if I did it.

1032
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:43,000
On the day of the funeral, I left the funeral hall holding a portrait of the deceased and people were rushing in.

1033
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I told them repeatedly “I’m sorry, I’m sorry”.

1034
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,800
< Tokyo, Tsukiji Honganji >
I told him “We can’t see anymore. This is the last time”.

1035
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:18,000
I came out of the funeral hall holding a portrait of him, and the voice of people from everywhere sounded like scream.

1036
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:31,000
Compared to their screaming and crying, I thought the portrait was too light.

1037
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:15,700
[♪Flame] Dear my sun, should I know how low & low?

1038
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,800
Dear my moon, should I know how low & low?

1039
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Dear my stars, if you hear the stars’ lamentation.

1040
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:31,000
Like a wind, it’s a small sound.

1041
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:40,500
Sadness will spread his arms and hug your shoulders.

1042
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:51,500
He will wrap you with the gently shaking dance.

1043
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It’s the flame of sadness.

1044
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Dear my mind, no matter what misfortunes they are, you need to say hello to them.

1045
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:22,500
Dear my hurts, Let’s get rid of the heavy stuff (like a wind) that you are always carrying.

1046
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:29,000
If it’s going to be forgotten by getting soaked in the night breeze, widen your stride.

1047
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Even though there wasn’t hide, the third album was completed.

1048
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:42,000
The person who succeeded Hide was Hide’s right-hand man, I.N.A.

1049
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I wanted to complete the album because I saw the people who gathered in Tsukiji.

1050
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Excuse me.

1051
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Suddenly I recall the memory.

1052
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,500
Sorry.

1053
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I wanted to deliver hide’s songs to the people somehow.

1054
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I will never forget the scene forever.

1055
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:15,800
I was about to complete the album “Ja, Zoo” on my responsibility.

1056
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:23,000
I can’t make music, so I asked I.N.A to complete the album in order to deliver it to people.

1057
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:48,000
I wanted to help people who have cut themselves off from the world and those who have been unable to hear Hide’s music since his death.

1058
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
The way to completion of “Ja, Zoo”

1059
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,500
We had to complete the unfinished album.

1060
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,800
Because that’s what hide left.

1061
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:13,000
There were songs in draft while there were the finished.

1062
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:17,300
Among them, only the recorded songs could be completed.

1063
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:27,500
Many people voiced their approval or disapproval on the news that “Ja, Zoo” would be completed without hide.

1064
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
It was a very hard work both physically and mentally.

1065
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Until now, hide has been making a decision.

1066
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,500
But from now on, I.N.A is responsible for everything.

1067
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:57,000
The hardest part was to make a decision.

1068
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Because the person to decide has disappeared.

1069
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:09,000
The recording began just a week after the funeral.

1070
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:15,000
I was mentally really messed up.

1071
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I.N.A, use all your talent only for me

1072
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:44,300
A week before “Ja, Zoo” release, hide’s colleagues started a live tour of 12 locations around the country.

1073
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:50,000
< October 22, 1998. Yokosuka Arts Theater >
The beginning was Yokosuka, the root and shrine of hide.

1074
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But there were a lot of conflicts between fans, staffs and members about the performance.

1075
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:03,000
What would hide want to do?

1076
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:07,000
Wouldn’t he want to play on his tour?

1077
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,500
Someone said, “Let’s make it happen”.

1078
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,300
“Let’s tour. We have to do it”.

1079
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,500
But no one was able to start.

1080
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,000
The members and staffs were people who were with hide when he was alive.

1081
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:28,500
When we gathered, I felt as if the air sank to the ground.

1082
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:33,800
Honestly it was extremely painful.

1083
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,500
There is no case that you go on tour without hero.

1084
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,100
We couldn’t expect what would happen.

1085
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:51,500
We didn’t figure out what to do even though we agonized over it for a long time.

1086
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
But we concluded that it’s better to do than not.

1087
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,500
Hide was gone that way.

1088
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:13,000
But we didn’t think like “It’s over. Dismiss!”

1089
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:22,000
We concluded that it is better to go on tour both for hide and for the fans.

1090
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,000
Unlike heretofore, hide can’t guide direction anymore.

1091
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:29,000
Therefore we wondered that who should play hide's role?

1092
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:31,000
I.N.A had to do it.

1093
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,500
Who would do it if it were not I.N.A? Who else?

1094
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
He had been with hide, so we thought it would work well.

1095
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:52,000
It was “Ja, Zoo” tour without hide, so I had to ask a lot of things to I.N.A.

1096
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:59,000
But I.N.A said he couldn’t do everything because he was not hide.

1097
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:04,000
So I worried about what I should do.

1098
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
We were so nervous until we started. How should we do?

1099
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:19,000
JOE said we were the ones that hide chose, so let’s play as a band.

1100
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That was a kind of motive.

1101
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,500
[♪Rocket Dive] High-speeding you are a moment’s spark.

1102
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:33,000
Speed freaks baby rocket dive!

1103
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,000
Spread your wings and you fly.

1104
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,000
Adios to yesterday I just waited.

1105
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,500
As soon as the live started, everyone there was crying.

1106
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,000
We cried and all the audience cried too.

1107
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,000
Everyone cried sadly.

1108
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,000
Is there such a concert?

1109
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Stress was beyond belief.

1110
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
The relationship between the members became strange.

1111
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,500
The staff also seemed to be out of their mind.

1112
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
On second thought, it was a little reckless.

1113
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:12,500
But I think it was good to do.

1114
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
We started in order to finish it but it does not end.

1115
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,500
It’s not over yet.

1116
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:27,000
We’re still on that extension.

1117
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:44,000
From the beginning of the last live day for “Ja, Zoo”, I kept apologizing for the audience.

1118
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:57,500
I was grateful to those who came, but I was much more sorry to the audience.

1119
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:04,000
As the tour went on, the audience enjoyed it.

1120
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:06,500
Thanks to that, the members were also healed.

1121
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:11,000
If the tour went on like the first day, members’ hearts would have broken.

1122
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:23,500
In hindsight, we tried not to distinguish between those who were fans from the old times and the general audience who came to the concert.

1123
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:30,000
If we split the two, we had to accept hide’s death.

1124
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,000
I was being distressed from start to finish.

1125
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:50,000
But it was meaningful that we laughed, even though the laughter was against our will.

1126
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,500
They thought about the future, not the memorial service.

1127
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:13,000
[♪Hurry Go Round] The crazy season is overflowing endlessly.

1128
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
< Released on November 21, 1998. The 3rd album “Ja, Zoo” >
Completion of “Ja, Zoo” full of agony and conflict.

1129
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:39,000
[♪Hurry Go Round] When the leaves of the ivy widely spread their roots, the scenery seen in the eyes passes away without sound.

1130
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:49,500
What I want to know and listen to as now is “Ja, Zoo” that I made with hide.

1131
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I really want to listen to it.

1132
01:51:53,500 --> 01:52:00,500
[♪Hurry Go Round] I don’t need to be saddened by the kicking of memory, but that doesn’t mean I’m happy.

1133
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I still think that it’s good enough.

1134
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:13,000
At that time, it was enough and it still is.

1135
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:26,000
[♪Hurry Go Round] There is no way to figure out, only the clarity went out yesterday.

1136
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:30,500
We can’t change the fact that hide passed away.

1137
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,700
I think finding out how we should live after that is the homework left for us.

1138
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,500
I’m not sure if I could continue to be a musician unless I met hide at that time.

1139
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I lived a really good time with him.

1140
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:51,000
I really appreciate him for training me this much.

1141
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:59,000
I came up with him doing everything in my power for fear of being left behind him.

1142
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:08,500
Honestly, I still do not believe hide has passed away.

1143
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I feel as if he’s here forever, and will say “Let’s do well” again.

1144
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:23,000
He showed a lot of fun things.

1145
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:27,000
He showed wonderful things as well as fun things.

1146
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,500
It was love.

1147
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,900
He would have been able to act if it was only on stage.

1148
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:38,000
But he was the same offstage.

1149
01:53:48,500 --> 01:54:02,000
The people around hide, the members, the staffs and everyone who was connected by hide all had the same mind.

1150
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:06,500
The bond as colleagues became stronger.

1151
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:16,500
If hide was alive and if I had grown even more, we would have dared to jump into the world stage.

1152
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:25,500
Hide was preparing to advance into the world.

1153
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:36,500
I’m going to live life to the full.

1154
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I will move on carrying hide’s name on my shoulders, carrying him on my back.

1155
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,000
He will continue to play the guitar vigorously.

1156
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
He will form a band again in the other world.

1157
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
He will.

1158
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,500
Ah, I talked about the other world.

1159
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
[♪Hurry Go Round] Let’s meet in spring.

1160
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,500
Let’s meet again in the spring

1161
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
17 years have passed since the day.

1162
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:45,000
There are always flowers sent by fans in front of his tombstone.

1163
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
50,000 fans attended the farewell ceremony.

1164
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:59,000
It was the funeral that was attended by the greatest number of people in Japan's postwar history.

1165
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,000
Tokyo, Tsukiji Honganji

1166
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:04,000
Tsukiji temple “Honganji” where the funeral ceremony was held.

1167
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:09,000
One side of the main hall is filled with hearts toward hide.

1168
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:16,000
People’s minds have reached from not only Japan but all over the world.

1169
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,500
Thanks to hide, I can be as I am now.

1170
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I try to let him hear the voice of fans no matter which venue I go to.

1171
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:38,000
Sometimes I speak aloud “Please let hide listen to your voices”.

1172
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I try to spread the greatness of hide to the world.

1173
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I think that’s the role given to me.

1174
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:03,000
The 3rd album “Ja, Zoo” is still going on.

1175
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,500
On December 10, 2014, “Co Gal” was released in a period of 16 years.

1176
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
This song was supposed to be on “Ja, Zoo”.

1177
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:25,000
< At that time, the demo tape left by hide was considered
to be impossible to reproduce because only humming remained >
[♪Co Gal] As talking the prepared words in a shy pose, let’s go with the shaking breast fixed.

1178
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,500
< Over time, based on vocaloid which is a voice synthesis technology developed by YAMAHA >

1179
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:33,000
Scattering the winds of the dark world with a rapid jet engine.

1180
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,000
I.N.A’s challenge has begun

1181
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:39,000
I.N.A collected hide’s voice for four months.

1182
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
< Lyrics of Go Gal left by hide >

1183
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:50,000
< I picked up every single voice out of the vocal tracks of all hide’s songs and combined it.
It was very difficult and lonely work. >

1184
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:02,000
When I make hide’s music, I feel like I’m with him.

1185
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I just want to convey it to people who like hide.

1186
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:14,500
< Hide’s favorite guitar >
[♪Co Gal] That's not lie. That's not true.

1187
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Until the day it collapses, I’ll fuck you and jelly.

1188
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,000
Even if everything is disappeared, let’s keep hugging.

1189
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:29,500
Co Gal was completed with a great restoration technology.

1190
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
“Ja, Zoo” was completed after a long time.

1191
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:39,000
But didn’t he have an empty heart when his work with hide was over?

1192
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
The important thing is not changing.

1193
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,500
The work with hide is the same.

1194
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
There is no big difference between now and the days when hide was alive.

1195
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:57,000
“I’m still with hide”.

1196
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,500
The song was completed as an extension of this thought.

1197
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:19,000
[♪Co Gal] The tragedy in your eyes is like watching a video.

1198
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Completion of “Co Gal”

1199
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:30,000
[♪Co Gal] I give a kiss to the part of you where there is no love.

1200
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,500
I give a kick to your tomorrow without a dream.

1201
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I want to keep delivering hide’s music, beyond generations.

1202
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:50,000
[♪Co Gal] Until the day it collapses
Until two of us burn down
The last count is

1203
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Hide’s wings that were called spoiled still keep flapping.

1204
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,500
[♪Junk Story] There are so many things I want to see.

1205
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
The beautiful scenery I have seen before.

1206
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:47,000
I’ve been to Disneyland with him.

1207
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Both of us were very noticeable.

1208
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Hide said “We are more eye-catching than Mickey Mouse”.

1209
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Even though it’s not so meaningful.

1210
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Aren’t you going to make the second episode of “Junk Story”?
